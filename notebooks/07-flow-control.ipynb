    "A biologist is interested in the genetic basis of height. She measures the heights of many subjects and sends off their DNA samples to a core for genotyping arrays. These arrays determine the DNA bases at the variable sites of the genome (known as single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs). Since humans are diploid, i.e. have two of each chromosome, each data point will be two DNA bases corresponding to the two chromosomes in each individual. At each SNP, there will be only three possible genotypes, e.g. AA, AG, GG for an A/G SNP. In order to test the correlation between a SNP genotype and height, she wants to perform a regression with an additive genetic model. However, she cannot do this with the data in the current form. She needs to convert the genotypes, e.g. AA, AG, and GG, to the numbers 0, 1, and 2, respectively (in the example the number corresponds the number of G bases the person has at that SNP). Since she has too much data to do this manually, e.g. in Excel, she comes to you for ideas of how to efficiently transform the data."
